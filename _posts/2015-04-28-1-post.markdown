This site has the main goal of share my world with others.

I'm a student and researcher and I have always something that keeps me busy. Therefore, this site had to be really simple to build and maintain. So, it means no SQL database, easy editing (no GUI), possibility of reusing information from another sources, capable of being deployed anywhere, compatible with versioning systems (Github).

My first attempt was something like about.me. The thing here was reuse information from other sources like LinkedIn, Facebook, Flickr and have a site that has no content. It only shows content from several services. But, my focus now is creating something where I can change information directly.

I saw Jekyll, which was already used by some of my friends with similar purposes. It seems perfect for me. Transform plain text into static website or blogs was really what I need. I installed, deployed and put it in Github hostage and voil√†! Any text editor without any know-how can edit content pages.

Everything is rendered and stored as static files but I can add some "not static" looking using JS.

The theme is inspired in the Danish Khan theme.
