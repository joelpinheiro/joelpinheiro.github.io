DataPreview was one of the tools developed in Human Monitoring project. DataPreview is a web application to preview real data that is stored in the main server. The information that is possible to preview in the web app is kinect, vital jacket, sensors, video, images and audio. Besides the preview, it is possible to analyse which and how much information the solution is stored or gathered. All information comes from a [JAX-RS](https://jax-rs-spec.java.net) service that works between [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/) and [Dropbox API](https://www.dropbox.com/developers) that is what we used to store all the gathered files from the inputs devices capture. The technologies that were applied in client were HTML5, jQuery and [D3](http://d3js.org/). In server side we worked with MongoDB, JAX-RS and Dropbox API.
