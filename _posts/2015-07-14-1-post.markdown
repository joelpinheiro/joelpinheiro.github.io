Next month I am going to do a eurotrip. This is something that I had put on my bucket list since I made one. The time has come and now it is for sure that I will do this. Me and two more friends are going to visit cities and places like Budapest, Zagreb, Split, Plitvice Lakes, Ljubljana, Bled, Vienna, Bratislava, Krakow, Prague, Berlin, Eindhoven and Bruges. We will buy 22 days 10 days flexi interrail ticket which means that we will have 22 days that we will be travelling by train to each one of these amazing places. I will post photos of this trip and all the beautiful landscapes that we are going to see. This is the plan that we defined.

Budapest -> (Zagreb) -> Split -> Plitvice Lakes -> Zagreb →  Ljubljana → Vienna → Bratislava → Krakow → Prague → Berlin → (Eindhoven) → Bruges
