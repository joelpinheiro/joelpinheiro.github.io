Next September, I will start my master's thesis. The subject of it is financial trading. This thesis comes because since I've worked in Calypso software I developed a refined taste about how all these financial products come together and how people make profit with that. As this interest never faded, some time ago I decided to make iTrading my master's thesis. iTrading will be a innovative product as there aren't any financial products multi-platform. There's hole in the market to make profit with iTrading. There isn't any native trading solution for OS X for instance. This software will be able to give to an economist or financial enthusiast a platform to trade in FOREX and CFD's with all advanced trading tools, plots analysis and real-time prices. Now, I'm researching for all the others similar applications to see besides a multi-platform what is missing in the market and where is the opportunity. I will write a bit more in the future about this since I am really enthusiastic.
