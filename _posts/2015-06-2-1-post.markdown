Hi, today I will write about Meteor.JS because I use it on my research project.

MeteorJS is an open-source, [production-ready](http://www.wired.com/2014/10/meteor/), real-time JavaScript web application framework written on top of Node.JS. It allows rapid prototyping and produces cross-platform code (Web, Android, iOS). Meteor use as front-end library Blaze which fulfills the same purpose as Angular, Backbone or Ember but is much simpler to use [(read more!)](https://www.meteor.com/blaze) and can be used with any of these libraries. (1) Blaze is also faster than Angular in high-throughput rendering tests. Meteor works well REST APIs using [DDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_Data_Protocol), a simple and powerful publish/subscribe protocol. The underlying database is MongoDB which Meteor works in real-time. While Angular is a front-end library and Sails a backend one, Meteor is a full-stack framework, comparable with Derby. (2) Since it is all JavaScript it can be supported in all devices and OSs featuring Hyperty Runtime (e.g. V8 JavaScript Engine). (3) The MVC model is replaced by MVM (Model-View-Mapper) which replace controller by ORM code that supports what views need to display data. Meteor controllers are on the client side. Meteor is package oriented, one of the package is [Vert.x Event Bus](https://github.com/jmusacchio/vertxbus/) that allow any meteor app to be able to connect to Vert.x components.

You can see an todo list that I have created only to see those features of Meteor.
