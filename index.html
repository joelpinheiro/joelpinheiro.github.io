Hi, I'm a <b>Software Engineer</b> from Aveiro, Portugal. I'm <b>currently finishing my master</b> and I hold a bachelor's degree in <b>Computer and Telematics Engineering</b> from Aveiro University.

Currently, I'm working at <b>Instituto de Telecomunicações</b> where I'm finishing my master thesis. I spend most of my time crafting and working on awesome projects. I consider myself as a <b>full stack</b> / integration engineer with know how with <b>software architecture</b>, <b>scalability</b> and <b>performance</b>. I am able to adapt to multicultural environments, gained through working experience abroad (Netherlands) having to deal with different nationalities in the same project. 

My hobbies, besides developing and all tech stuff, include sports, music and travelling.
