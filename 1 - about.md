<h4>Joel's bio</h4>

Hello, I'm a Software Engineer from Aveiro, Portugal. I'm currently finishing my master and I hold a bachelor's degree in Computer and Telematics Engineering from Aveiro University.

Currently, I'm working at Instituto de Telecomunicações where I'm finishing my master thesis. I spend most of my time crafting and working on awesome projects. I define me as a full stack / integration engineer with know how with software architecture, scalability and performance. I am able to adapt to multicultural environments, gained through working experience abroad (Netherlands) having to deal with different nationalities in the same project. 

My hobbies, besides developing and all tech stuff, include sports, music and travelling.
